This action runs the [black formatter](https://github.com/psf/black) with reviewdog on pull requests to improve code review experience.

## Quick Start

In it's simplest form this action can be used to annotate the changes the [black](https://github.com/psf/black) formatter would make if it was run on the code.

```yaml
name: reviewdog
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  linter_name:
    name: runner / black formatter
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: reviewdog/action-black@v2
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.github_token }}
          # Change reviewdog reporter if you need [github-pr-check, github-check].
          reporter: github-pr-check
          # Change reporter level if you need.
          # GitHub Status Check won't become failure with a warning.
          level: warning
```

## Format your code

This action is meant to annotate any possible changes that would need to be made to make your code adhere to the [black formatting guidelines](github.com/psf/black). It does not apply these changes to your codebase. If you also want to apply the changes to your repository, you can use the [reviewdog/action-suggester](https://github.com/reviewdog/action-suggester). You can find examples of how this is done can be found in [rickstaa/action-black](https://github.com/rickstaa/action-black/)
